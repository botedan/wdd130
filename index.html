            <p>Hello! My name is Daniel Botelho and I am from Brazil, Florianopolis. I see active involvement in social and volunteer projects as a unique opportunity for personal and professional growth. Aiming to combine voluntary work and professional success. Seeking improvement in the areas of software development, information security and finance, which I am training myself to enter this field and achieve success through the work and knowledge obtained along the way. Looking to keep an eye on opportunities to improve professionally and make dreams come true. </p>
